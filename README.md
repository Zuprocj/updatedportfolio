# Updated Portfolio

Overhauled the the first porftolio assignment.  I made the website a one-pager instead of multiple pages. 
Added my picture and links to my Github and Linkedin profile. Also, added a contact form that should store 
user information onto my firebase database. However, I am still having problems having it work. 
Linked 4 projects to the portfolio.  Added a neat navbar that appears when scrolling.
