**Updated the portfolio sections. added cards. Links to deployed page and github page where applicable. Re-did some of the anchor tags so that the page correctly displays each section. Removed home link from the nav bar. Thank you to TA Tassa for suggesting these changes.

# Updated Portfolio

Overhauled the the first porftolio assignment.  I made the website a one-pager instead of multiple pages. 
Added my picture and links to my Github and Linkedin profile. Also, added a contact form that should store 
user information onto my firebase database. However, I am still having problems having it work. 
Linked 4 projects to the portfolio.  Added a neat navbar that appears when scrolling.
